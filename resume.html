		<p>Evernote apps and products make modern life manageable, by letting you easily collect and find everything that matters. My role at Evernote was to create new products, first at their Austin Headquarters dedicated to new product development, and then at their Redwood city office. I contributed to and oversaw the launch of Skitch on iOS, Android and Windows, as well as a from-the-ground-up rewrite for Mac. In addition to Skitch I designed and prototyped many new product experiences, both extensions of the core product, and enhancements thereof. I designed the core UX for the Evernote Market as well as engineered the full experience on iOS.</p>
